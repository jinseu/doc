### bash

Bash有几种不同的运行模式，login shell与non-login shell，interactive shell与non-interactive shell（比如执行shell脚本）。这两种分类方法是交叉的，也就是说一个login shell可能是一个interactive shell，也可能是个non-interactive shell。

login shell和interactive shell的定义如下：
       
A login shell is one whose first character of argument zero is a -, or one started with the --login option.

An  interactive  shell is one started without non-option arguments and without the -c option whose standard input and error are both connected to terminals (as determined by isatty(3)), or one started  with  the  -i option.   

在下列情况下，我们可以获得一个login shell：

1. 登录系统时获得的顶层shell，无论是通过本地终端登录，还是通过网络ssh登录。这种情况下获得的login shell是一个交互式shell。
2. 在终端下使用--login选项调用bash，可以获得一个交互式login shell。
3. 在脚本中使用--login选项调用bash（比如在shell脚本第一行做如下指定：#!/bin/bash --login），此时得到一个非交互式的login shell。
4. 使用"su -"切换到指定用户时，获得此用户的login shell。如果不使用"-"，则获得non-login shell。

login shell与non-login shell的主要区别在于它们启动时会读取不同的配置文件，从而导致环境不一样。login shell启动时首先读取/etc/profile全局配置，然后依次查找~/.bash_profile、~/.bash_login、~/.profile三个配置文件，并且读取第一个找到的并且可读的文件。login shell退出时读取并执行~/.bash_logout中的命令。

交互式的non-login shell启动时读取~/.bashrc资源文件。非交互式的non-login shell不读取上述所有配置文件，而是查找环境变量BASH_ENV，读取并执行BASH_ENV指向的文件中的命令。

如果使用命令"sh"调用bash，bash会尽可能保持向后兼容。作为login shell启动时，bash依次读取/etc/profile和~/.profile配置文件。作为non-login shell启动时，bash读取环境变量ENV指向的文件。

具体关于bash配置文件的读取顺序是这么定义的：

when bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login  option, it  first  reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.  After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and  reads  and  executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.  The --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.

When a login shell exits, bash reads and executes commands from the file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.

When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started,  bash  reads  and  executes  commands  from /etc/bash.bashrc  and  ~/.bashrc,  if these files exist.  This may be inhibited by using the --norc option.The --rcfile file option will force bash to read and execute commands from file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.

When  bash  is  started  non-interactively,  to  run a shell script, for example, it looks for the variable BASH_ENV in the environment, expands its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute.  Bash behaves as if the following command were executed:
     
    if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fi

but the value of the PATH variable is not used to search for the filename.


## 内置操作符

### 数组与关联数组


关联数组

关联数组需要事先申明

    #ass_array被申明为一个关联数组
    declare -A ass_array
    ass_array[index1]=val1
    # ${!array_var[*]} 列出关联数组（普通数组）的索引
    # ${!array_var[@]} 同上
    echo ${!array_var[*]}
    # ${array_var[*]} 列出关联数组（普通数组）的值
    # ${array_var[@]} 同上
    echo ${array_var[*]}

### let

可以执行基本的算术操作。例如自增，自减等。
```
let no++
let no--
let no+=6
```

## 特殊参数
```
 Special Parameters
       The shell treats several parameters specially.  These parameters may only be referenced; assignment to them
       is not allowed.
      *      Expands  to  the  positional parameters, starting from one.  When the expansion is not within double
              quotes, each positional parameter expands to a separate word.  In contexts where  it  is  performed,
              those words are subject to further word splitting and pathname expansion.  When the expansion occurs
              within double quotes, it expands to a single word with the value of each parameter separated by  the
              first character of the IFS special variable.  That is, "$*" is equivalent to "$1c$2c...", where c is
              the first character of the value of the IFS variable.  If IFS is unset, the parameters are separated
              by spaces.  If IFS is null, the parameters are joined without intervening separators.
       @      Expands  to  the  positional parameters, starting from one.  When the expansion occurs within double
              quotes, each parameter expands to a separate word.  That is, "$@" is equivalent to "$1" "$2" ...  If
              the  double-quoted  expansion  occurs  within a word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined
              with the beginning part of the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with
              the  last part of the original word.  When there are no positional parameters, "$@" and $@ expand to
              nothing (i.e., they are removed).
       #      Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal.
       ?      Expands to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
       -      Expands to the current option flags as specified upon invocation, by the  set  builtin  command,  or
              those set by the shell itself (such as the -i option).
       $      Expands  to the process ID of the shell.  In a () subshell, it expands to the process ID of the cur‐
              rent shell, not the subshell.
       !      Expands to the process ID of the job most recently placed into the background, whether  executed  as
              an asynchronous command or using the bg builtin (see JOB CONTROL below).
       0      Expands  to the name of the shell or shell script.  This is set at shell initialization.  If bash is
              invoked with a file of commands, $0 is set to the name of that file.  If bash is started with the -c
              option,  then  $0  is  set to the first argument after the string to be executed, if one is present.
              Otherwise, it is set to the filename used to invoke bash, as given by argument zero.
       _      At shell startup, set to the absolute pathname used to invoke the shell or shell script  being  exe‐
              cuted  as passed in the environment or argument list.  Subsequently, expands to the last argument to
              the previous command, after expansion.  Also set to the full pathname used to  invoke  each  command
              executed and placed in the environment exported to that command.  When checking mail, this parameter
              holds the name of the mail file currently being checked.
```


### 函数

函数的定义方式如下：

```
fname()
{
statements
}
```

在函数内部参数的访问通过如下形式：
$1 第一个参数
$2 第二个参数
$@ 全部参数 "$1" "$2"
$* 全部参数 "$1c$2" c是IFS第一个字符（IFS内部字段分隔符）

### 内建命令

#### cd

#### read

read命令可以从输入中读取字符。并且限定读取字符的数量以及超时时间。

-n：指定读取的字符数量
-p：显示提示信息
-t：设置超时时间
-d：指定分隔符

### 语法

#### 循环

for循环

while循环
```
while condition #条件为真则循环
do
   statement
done
```
util循环
```
util condition #会一直循环直到条件为真
do
   statement
done
```
### 补充内容

可以将命令放入（）中，从而生成独立的子shell
