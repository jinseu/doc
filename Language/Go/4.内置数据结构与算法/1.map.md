## map

Go 语言运行时同时使用了多个数据结构组合表示哈希表，其中 runtime.hmap 是最核心的结构体。关于Go 语言中map的实现原理，在代码注释中有比较详细的说明，直接引用在此

> A map is just a hash table. The data is arranged into an array of buckets. Each bucket contains up to 8 key/elem pairs. The low-order bits of the hash are used to select a bucket. Each bucket contains a few high-order bits of each hash to distinguish the entries within a single bucket.
> If more than 8 keys hash to a bucket, we chain on extra buckets. When the hashtable grows, we allocate a new array of buckets twice as big. Buckets are incrementally copied from the old bucket array to the new bucket array.

Map iterators walk through the array of buckets and return the keys in walk order (bucket #, then overflow chain order, then bucket index).  To maintain iteration semantics, we never move keys within their bucket (if we did, keys might be returned 0 or 2 times).  When growing the table, iterators remain iterating through the old table and must check the new table if the bucket they are iterating through has been moved ("evacuated") to the new table.

// Picking loadFactor: too large and we have lots of overflow
// buckets, too small and we waste a lot of space. I wrote
// a simple program to check some stats for different loads:
// (64-bit, 8 byte keys and elems)
//  loadFactor    %overflow  bytes/entry     hitprobe    missprobe
//        4.00         2.13        20.77         3.00         4.00
//        4.50         4.05        17.30         3.25         4.50
//        5.00         6.85        14.77         3.50         5.00
//        5.50        10.55        12.94         3.75         5.50
//        6.00        15.27        11.67         4.00         6.00
//        6.50        20.90        10.79         4.25         6.50
//        7.00        27.14        10.15         4.50         7.00
//        7.50        34.03         9.73         4.75         7.50
//        8.00        41.10         9.40         5.00         8.00
//
// %overflow   = percentage of buckets which have an overflow bucket
// bytes/entry = overhead bytes used per key/elem pair
// hitprobe    = # of entries to check when looking up a present key
// missprobe   = # of entries to check when looking up an absent key
//
// Keep in mind this data is for maximally loaded tables, i.e. just
// before the table grows. Typical tables will be somewhat less loaded.

```Golang
type hmap struct {
    // Note: the format of the hmap is also encoded in cmd/compile/internal/gc/reflect.go.
    // Make sure this stays in sync with the compiler's definition.
    count     int // # live cells == size of map.  Must be first (used by len() builtin)
    flags     uint8
    B         uint8  // log_2 of # of buckets (can hold up to loadFactor * 2^B items)
    noverflow uint16 // approximate number of overflow buckets; see incrnoverflow for details
    hash0     uint32 // hash seed

    buckets    unsafe.Pointer // array of 2^B Buckets. may be nil if count==0.
    oldbuckets unsafe.Pointer // previous bucket array of half the size, non-nil only when growing
    nevacuate  uintptr        // progress counter for evacuation (buckets less than this have been evacuated)

    extra *mapextra // optional fields
}

// A bucket for a Go map.
type bmap struct {
    // tophash generally contains the top byte of the hash value
    // for each key in this bucket. If tophash[0] < minTopHash,
    // tophash[0] is a bucket evacuation state instead.
    tophash [bucketCnt]uint8
    // Followed by bucketCnt keys and then bucketCnt elems.
    // NOTE: packing all the keys together and then all the elems together makes the
    // code a bit more complicated than alternating key/elem/key/elem/... but it allows
    // us to eliminate padding which would be needed for, e.g., map[int64]int8.
    // Followed by an overflow pointer.
}
