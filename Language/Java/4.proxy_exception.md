### Exception

#### 基本语法

#### Exception类层次

所有异常类的基类是`java.lang.Throwable`,Throwable 有两个直接子类`Error`和`Excption`。

An Error is a subclass of Throwable that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch. Most such errors are abnormal conditions. The ThreadDeath error, though a "normal" condition, is also a subclass of Error because most applications should not try to catch it.

A method is not required to declare in its throws clause any subclasses of Error that might be thrown during the execution of the method but not caught, since these errors are abnormal conditions that should never occur.
